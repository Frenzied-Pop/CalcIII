# 🔁 Stokes' Theorem & Green's Theorem – Summary Notes

## 📘 Stokes' Theorem

**Stokes' Theorem** connects the surface integral of the **curl** of a vector field over a surface `S` with a **line integral** around the boundary curve `∂S` of that surface:

```math
\iint_S (\nabla \times \vec{F}) \cdot d\vec{A} = \oint_{\partial S} \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{s}
```

- $$\vec{F}$$: Vector field
- $$d\vec{A}$$: Oriented surface element (normal to the surface)
- $$d\vec{s}$$: Tangent vector around the boundary
- Relates **rotation in the field (curl)** to **circulation** around the boundary

### 🔄 Intuition
- Think of integrating the "twist" (curl) across a surface.
- This is equivalent to adding up the vector field's projection around the edge.
- **Curl = local spinning**; the theorem equates total spin on the surface with circulation along its edge.

## 📘 Green's Theorem

**Green’s Theorem** is a 2D version of Stokes' theorem, applying to a region in the plane:

```math
\iint_{S} \left( \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial y} \right) dx\,dy = \oint_{\partial S} (F_1 \, dx + F_2 \, dy)
```

- $$F_1$$, $$F_2$$: Components of the vector field $$\vec{F} = (F_1, F_2)$$
- The **left** side measures local "swirl" in the region.
- The **right** side sums up the flow around the boundary.

## 🧠 Physical Meaning

- Stokes' Theorem: Circulation **on the boundary** equals **total curl** inside.
- Green's Theorem: Circulation around a **2D region's perimeter** equals total **2D curl** inside.
- Both describe **conservation of angular momentum** in physics and are used in:
  - Fluid flow
  - Airfoil lift
  - Electromagnetism
  - Vector calculus simplifications

## 🧮 Computing Area via Green’s Theorem

To compute the **area** of a region using line integrals:
```math
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \oint_{\partial S} (x \, dy - y \, dx)
```
- Based on choosing a vector field: $$\vec{F} = (-y, x)$$
- Curl of this field is 2, hence:
```math
\iint_S 2 \, dA = \oint_{\partial S} (-y \, dx + x \, dy)
```
- Dividing by 2 gives the area.

✅ Surveyors used this historically to find land area by walking the perimeter!
