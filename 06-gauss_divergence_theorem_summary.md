# 🌐 Gauss’s Divergence Theorem – Summary Notes

## 📘 The Theorem
Gauss’s divergence theorem relates the **flux** of a vector field through a closed surface to the **divergence** of that field inside the volume enclosed by the surface:

```math
\iint_S \vec{F} \cdot \hat{n} \, dS = \iiint_V (\nabla \cdot \vec{F}) \, dV
```

- **Left**: Total flux out of a closed surface `S`.
- **Right**: Integral of divergence over volume `V`.

---

## 🌪️ Physical Meaning
- It accounts for how much “stuff” (mass, momentum, energy) is **leaving or entering** a volume.
- Used to derive **conservation laws**: if a quantity is conserved, any change inside must be due to flow across the surface.

---

## 🧠 Intuition
- Think of dividing the volume into many tiny cells.
- The internal flow between adjacent cells **cancels out**.
- Only **flow across the boundary** remains.
- This leads to the **equality** of surface and volume integrals.

## 📦 Application to Conservation Laws
### Conservation of Mass
Let:
- $$ρ(x, t)$$ be the **density**
- $$\vec{F} = \rho \vec{u}$$ be the **mass flux**

Total mass:
```math
\text{Mass} = \iiint_V \rho \, dV
```

Rate of change:
```math
\frac{d}{dt} \iiint_V \rho \, dV = - \iint_S \rho \vec{u} \cdot \hat{n} \, dS
```

Using Gauss’s theorem:
```math
\frac{d}{dt} \iiint_V \rho \, dV = - \iiint_V \nabla \cdot (\rho \vec{u}) \, dV
```

Bringing both terms into one integral:
```math
\iiint_V \left( \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \vec{u}) \right) dV = 0
```

Because this holds for any volume:
```math
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \vec{u}) = 0
```

✅ This is the **Continuity Equation** (mass conservation).

## 🧪 Special Case: Incompressible Flow
If $$ρ$$ is constant:
```math
\nabla \cdot \vec{u} = 0
```
This simplifies the continuity equation for incompressible fluids.

---

## 🔄 Why This Matters
- Most **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)** in physics come from **conservation laws**.
- Gauss’s theorem allows us to move from surface integrals to **volume integrals**, making PDEs easier to handle.
- Works when the vector field is **continuous**.
